<p>
  Pierogi are filled dumplings of Central European origin made by wrapping
  unleavened dough around a savory or sweet filling and cooking in boiling
  water. These dumplings are popular in Slavic (Polish, Slovak, Russian,
  Ukrainian), Baltic (Latvian, Lithuanian), and other Eastern European cuisines,
  where they are known under their local names.

    In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the
    egg, sour cream, and 1/4 cup of butter; stir until the dough comes together.
    Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth. Cover
    and refrigerate for 1 hour.

    In a large skillet, melt 1/2 cup of butter with the onion. Cook and stir
    until the onion is soft and translucent. Remove from the heat and set aside.

    Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into
    3 inch rounds. Place a small spoonful of the onion mixture onto the center
    of each round. Moisten the edges with water, fold over, and press together
    with a fork to seal.
